# Highway to Undercity

Highway is a hardware grant program where you can design any project, and we'll send you the parts & funding up to 350 USD *per project* you need to build it!

Repeat to get invited to Undercity, a 4-day hardware hackathon, July 11-14 @ GitHub HQ.

There's both beginner & advanced tracks, so everyone is included. There'll be new content, freebies, and other awesome stuff from now until July 31st.

## How to start

If you're making a custom project, this is your place to add it to the gallery!

*Remember to read through the [Project guidelines](https://highway.hackclub.com/advanced/project-guidelines).*

Fork this repo and head over to the submissions.yml file - add the URL of your project there.

It should look something like this:

```
projects:
  - "https://github.com/Dongathan-Jong/SpotifyDisplay"
  - "your_repo_link"
```

We'll check if you have a README.md and JOURNAL.md file, and merge it after that. You're free to start working on your project!

# Website development

Ooooh, you're in the README to figure out how the actual highway website works? Sure!

It's a standard rails codebase, but when you first start up you might want to run `bin/rails projects:clone` to download all the submissions.
